# Software Tutorials - REST API - Group Project

This folder contains the backend-part of Software Tutorials Application.

## Technologies Used
	1. Spring Boot - Java for RESTful API

## Remark

<pre>

	1. This RESTful API has its own documentation based on swagger 2 (Open API Specification). 
	   The documentation can be accessed by going to the route "/swagger" after running the 
	   project.

	2. Since Admins cannot signup for the system, we have used CommandLine runner to create 
	   an admin with 
	   	1. Username - admin
		2. Password - admin
	   So you can use this user to explore about the admin
